# Bool_Eagle
Course Work "Boolean extended calculator" 
This project was written during september-december of 2018 year.
Calculator has a conditional brand name "Bool Eagle", because it is written for educational purposes. 
Calculator can calculate ordinary operations like addition, substraction, multiplication, division and etc.
It also has a boolean part, that calculate boolean functions and print value.
For boolean functions implementations I use perfectly disjunctive normal form in Armenian has this look "կատարյալ դիզունկտիվ նորմալ ձև (ԴՆՁ)"
For painting functioanl elements scheme(in Armenian "ֆունկցիոնալ տարրերից սխեման(ՖՏՍ)") I create child process, that perform painting.

In addition I inset a new function "Rome" that converts arabic number to romance. 

GUI is performed via Qt 5.6.0  

P.S. In Application folder exist Calculator.exe, this is a main application. Run it for opening the calculator.
